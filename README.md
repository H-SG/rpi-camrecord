# rpi-camrecord
Some code I wrote in undergrad for an autonomous video recorder using a Raspberry Pi.

This was some of my first Python code, written when I had done most of my previous work using C and C++

The Pi was used in a rugged enclosure to capture images of mineral slurries in spiral concentrators. It had to be self contained with minimal external ingress points. The code was run as a startup script and bridging two GPIO pins would start recording and turn on two LEDs for sufficient light.
